You can download a quick API reference sheet suitable for viewing or printing here: [PDF (OUTDATED)](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/files/12447661/tic-80_cheatsheet.pdf).  The Wiki also includes a [Cheatsheet](Cheatsheet) for fast reference. And you can use `export help <file>` to export all help information into a markdown file.

## Callbacks

Callbacks are functions that your game defines and that TIC-80 calls automatically.  Every game at a minimum must define a `TIC` function.

* [TIC](TIC) - Called 60 times per second (60 FPS); the main update/draw callback. **Required.**
* [BOOT](BOOT) - Called once when yout cartridge is first booted
* [SCN(n)](SCN) - *(deprecated as of 0.90, use `BDR(n)` now instead)*
* [BDR(n)](BDR) - Called prior to each scanline/borderline render (allowing for palette swaps, etc).
* [OVR](OVR) - Called last and draws to a separate layer (using a separate palette).
* [MENU](MENU) - Used to handle custom items in the Game Menu (introduced in 1.0)

### Sequencing

```
-- cartridge is booted
   BOOT()

-- frame begins (at 60 frames per second)

   TIC()
   OVR()
   BDR(0..143)

-- frame ends
```

`SCN` callsbacks are not included in the above table because `SCN` has been deprecated.  You should now use [BDR](BDR) instead of `SCN`.
